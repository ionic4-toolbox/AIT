      As being a developer who is physically active, I wanted an app that suits all my timing needs when exercising in intervals.
      This app took tremendous amount of time and energy to develop. The outcome is an invaluable tool I crafted for myself
      and as a humanist I'm sharing it with you for free and ad-free too. If you find this app invaluable tool too, please
      consider donating by a tap of the button below that will direct you to donation information and please show your support
      for this app on Google Play. If you are unable to donate, please continue enjoy using it and please show your support
      on Google Play. Thanks. - Marc Kassay
