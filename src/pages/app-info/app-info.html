      As being a developer, physically active and humanist, I wanted an app that suits all my timing needs when working out. This
      app took tremendous amount of time and energy to develop. The outcome of this is a valuable tool for myself which I
      wanted to share to all for free, ad-free too. If you find this app adds value to your life, please consider donating
      by clicking on the button below for more information on how to and show your support for the app on Google Play. If
      you are unable to donate, please continue to use it and show your support on Google Play. Thanks. - Marc Kassay
