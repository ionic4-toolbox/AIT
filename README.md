Another interval timer (AiT) that targets mobile devices for your timing needs.  This application has been intended for interval workouts, where there are active and inactive segments.

Features in this application are:
* Adjustable countdown timer before starting interval timer.
* Enable/disable 5, 10 and 15 second warnings to indicate active segment is approaching it's end.
* Changeable themes; 'light' or 'dark' base themes along with 'monokai' and 'RGB and sometimes Y' accent themes.

Possible future features:
* Stopwatch that laps on a tap.
* Fullscreen mode when timer is running.

## About
This is an Ionic 3.8 project that is intended to target Android and iOS devices.  Ionic leverages Angular, Cordova, RxJS, Sass, TypeScript and Webpack, to name a few.  This was my first project using Ionic.

Currently on Google Play, this app is available in beta status.  Please contribute with feedback:
https://play.google.com/apps/testing/github.marckassay.ait

I'm unsure when or if I will have this on Apple iTunes.
