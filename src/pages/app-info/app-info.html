      As being a developer, physically active and humanist, I wanted an app that suits all my timing needs when working out. This
      app took tremendous amount of time and energy to develop. The outcome of this is a valuable tool for myself which I'm
      sharing to all for free and ad-free too. If you find this app adds value to your life, please consider donating by
      a tap of the button below for information on how to donate and show your support for the app on Google Play. If you
      are unable to donate, please enjoy continuing to use it and show your support on Google Play too. Thanks. - Marc Kassay
